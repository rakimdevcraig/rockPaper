Rock Paper Scissors

This was a simple game that allows the user to flip choose rock, paper, and play against the computer. After the user makes their selection they are informed whether they won, lost, or tied to the computer.

Demo:


How it's made:
Tech used: HTML, Javascript, Node

The HTML has the rock, paper, and scissors selection buttons for the user to choose. The javascript was used to make the conditional rules for the game according to regular rock paper and scissors rules. It was also used to make the computer's choice a random choice so the user doesn't feel like the game is skewed in any way and lastly the javascript wasused to print the result of the game to the Dom. Node was used to create a simple server for this game that can be locally hosted. At this point I don't know how to make the server read more than one file so I have my HTML and javascript in one file.

Optimizations:
Due to time constraints I wasn't able to inform the user on what the computer chose so they just know whether they won or lost but not exactly why. I also don't know how to make my server read more than one file so I would like to add those changes to my file in due time along with a scoreboard to keep track of wins and losses.

Lessons Learned:
This is my first project using node and while i'm not getting it to read multiple files yet I am able to run a simple locally hosted server, but with a bit more studying i'll be able to incorporate a css file and javascript seperately from my html.

Examples:
Look out for some other projects with me using node more effectively,
